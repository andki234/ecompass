# Project Overview

I'm exploring the capabilities of the ESP32-S3, focusing on utilizing the LIS3MDL and LSM6DSOX sensors. To gain practical experience and insights, I've embarked on a project to create an e-compass. This project serves two main purposes:

1. **Sensor Utilization**: To gain a comprehensive understanding of how to effectively use the LIS3MDL and LSM6DSOX sensors.
2. **ESP32 Development**: To learn and gain hands-on experience with coding and development on the ESP32 platform.

While my primary focus is on understanding and implementing the sensors, this project also offers an opportunity to familiarize myself with the ESP32-S3 development environment. Both from a hardware and software point.
